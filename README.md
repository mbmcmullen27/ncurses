# Dan Gookin's Guide to Ncurses Programming
We got a book about ncurses and we're coding along.

## Hello World!

- we don't 'hello world,' we 'glub... glub...'
- (Dan Gookin doesn't 'hello world' either apparently, the book does a 'Goodbye, cruel world!' then a 'Goodbye, cruel C programming!')

```bash
cd glub
clang glub.c -l ncurses
./a.out
```
